# Dimensional Radio — Public Description

Dimensional Radio is the tool that lets a DJ load a track, turn a knob, and lead an audience into another musical world — one that is rigorously beat‑synchronous and rhythmically locked to the source, and that remains mixable and contextually appropriate until it becomes very different (until the performer deliberately takes the room into a different dimension). The performer may not always know which "dimension" will appear next; what they will always know is that the material is derived from their chosen source and preserves the groove and transient structure up to the point of departure.

This is not a canned novelty or a bulk‑generation loophole. Dimensional Radio is a live instrument first: it gives the performer immediate, tangible control over how far a piece of music can drift from itself — and, crucially, when to stop. Turning the knob is the moment you choose: keep the groove, step sideways, or push the room into a place nobody expected. DJing is risky by nature; Dimensional Radio simply makes that risk deliberate, readable, and in the hands of the performer.

On stage
- Turn a knob, feel the room tilt. The performer's movement is the moment; the crowd reads it in real time.  
- Visual feedback tells you when a remix bank is warmed and ready, when a variation is final, and gives you an instant return to the original. That clarity keeps creative choices conscious instead of accidental.  
- You can be careful or you can be reckless. Either way, you're in control.

Prepare or play
- Prepare when you need control: generate a bank of variations ahead of a gig, listen to them, and load the ones that fit your set — so improvisation becomes a deliberate choice, not a gamble.  
- Play when you want the moment: leave prompts and seeds open, explore on the spot, or invite the crowd to suggest directions. Anything goes.

Studio and creative practice
- In the studio, Dimensional Radio is a creative workbench: deeper parameters, exportable variations, and conversational prompts help shape ideas quickly and explore arrangements you might never have written by hand.  
- Use it to prototype arrangements, breathe life into unreleased material, or collaborate with others who riff off the same musical skeleton.

Rights and ethical defaults
- Derivatives of third‑party recordings are intended for live performance by default; publishing or commercial release requires appropriate rights and clearances.  
- Material you own is yours to export and publish. The system surfaces provenance and usage notes so everyone involved understands what can and cannot be done with a generated variation.
- The scene is still learning how to deal with the wonderful new tools we were afforded. Rest assured, we will learn along with it and adapt, while remaining ethically aligned with the general consensus. To this we reserve the right. 

Why this matters
Dimensional Radio is a unique tool of performance: a way to travel through musical space with intention and adventure — while keeping the dancefloor in a zone of controlled discovery that they experience alongside the performer. It's a new tool for the ever‑evolving scene of modular genre combinations and invention. This is what music is about.
